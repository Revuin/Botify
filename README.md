# Botify

Collection of bots for Tower of Fantasy. These are hack-free so they are much safer to use because they don’t do anything different than what a regular player can do. 

**Features:**
- Attack Loop
  - AFK farms nearby enemies using left clicks, skills (key 1), and relics (key 2 & 3). Useful for raids and world bosses
- Boss Chest
  - Spams F and uses Perfect Decipher once a nearby boss chest is available. 
- Critical Abyss
  - Plays Critical Abyss. Uses jetpack to fly to the middle area and kills nearby enemy players. Recommended to equip Lin to R
- Daily Tasks
  - Claims all available rewards and completes certain daily tasks.
  - Tasks:
    - Reward Recovery
    - Buy 1x Vitality solution
    - Daily supply box
    - Mia's Kitchen
    - Weekly rewards
    - Daily bounty (Clicks submit for any bounties that can be completed)
    - Supply Run
    - Rewards
    - Battle Pass
    - Crew
    - Building
    - Appointed Research (Core only) (Will be updated to the newest equipment instead in the future)
    - Mailbox
- Dimensional Trials
  - Plays Dimensional Trials and enables auto-battle for weapon materials
- Dream Machine
  - Kills the 2 named enemies in Aesperia repeatedly (See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_HFqR7w430 for the location). Recommended to start in the crevice between the rocks and the wall so that if you get hit, you’ll be hit into the wall. This was built with Samir bound to R and Cocoritter to Q
- Event
  - Plays the Half-Anniversary Event. Recommended to run this overnight because it'll get last place each time`, which rewards only 100 tokens
- Frontier Clash
  - Plays Frontier Clash and enables auto-battle for exp, support points, and vehicle parts
- JO Carnival Party
  - (In development) Not fully working because it does not go to the chest right now. Recommended to equip Lin or long range weapon to R
- JO Sadness Valley
  - (In development) Not fully working. Detecting the boss stage platform doesn't work reliably right now. If you want to try making this work, replace img/SadnessValleyEnd.png with a screenshot of the ground to the bottom-left of your character's feet once you're at the boss stage platform
Jumps off repeatedly until the boss stage is detected. Next, it runs up to boss, enables auto-battle, and opens chest once boss is dead
- Join game and Auto battle
  - Used for games with long queues or when waiting for a party leader to start a game. Clicks the Approve button once it appears and enables auto-battle
- RAID
  - (In development) Not fully working. Detection for the rewards end screen is untested. Joins the top 3 Raids with the highest rewards. Run up to boss and press F6 to start an attack loop
- Sequential Phantasm
  - Plays all 3 Sequential Phantasm stages. Recommended to equip Lin to R
- Left-click Turbo
  - Holding middle click will spam left click
