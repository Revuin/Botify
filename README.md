# Botify

Updated for Version 2.4 but I will no longer be updating this since I quit the game. 

Collection of bots for Tower of Fantasy. These are hack-free so they are much safer to use because they don’t do anything different than what a regular player can do. 

**Features:**
- Attack Loop
  - AFK farms nearby enemies using left clicks, skills (key 1), and relics (key 2 & 3). Useful for raids and world bosses
- Boss Chest
  - Spams F and uses Perfect Decipher once a nearby boss chest is available. 
- Critical Abyss
  - (Not working for 2.4) Plays Critical Abyss. Uses jetpack to fly to the middle area and kills nearby enemy players. Recommended to equip Lin to R
- Daily Tasks
  - Claims all available rewards and completes certain daily tasks such as:
    - Reward Recovery
    - Buy 1x Vitality solution
    - Daily supply box
    - Mia's Kitchen
    - Weekly rewards
    - Daily bounty (Clicks submit for any bounties that can be completed)
    - Supply Run
    - Rewards
    - Battle Pass
    - Crew (Submit/Accept crew missions and donate)
    - Building (Claim building materials)
    - Appointed Research (Core only) (Will be updated to the newest equipment instead in the future)
    - Mailbox
    - Commissary (Untested, buys weekly items from the commissary if it's Monday)
- Dimensional Trials
  - Plays Dimensional Trials and enables auto-battle for weapon materials
- Dream Machine
  - Kills the 2 named enemies in Aesperia repeatedly (See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_HFqR7w430 for the location). Recommended to start in the crevice between the rocks and the wall so that if you get hit, you’ll be hit into the wall. This was built with Samir bound to R and Cocoritter to Q
- Frontier Clash
  - Plays Frontier Clash and enables auto-battle for exp, support points, and vehicle parts
- JO Carnival Party
  - Plays Joint Operation Carnival Party difficulty 4. Make sure to turn off message barrage in each of the chat channels because it messes up when the bot hits the escape key. 
- JO Sadness Valley
  - (In development) Not fully working and there's likely no plan to fix it right now. Detecting the boss stage platform doesn't work reliably. If you want to try making this work, replace img/SadnessValleyEnd.png with a screenshot of the ground to the bottom-left of your character's feet once you're at the boss stage platform
Jumps off repeatedly until the boss stage is detected. Next, it runs up to boss, enables auto-battle, and opens chest once boss is dead
- Join game and Auto battle
  - Used for games with long queues or when waiting for a party leader to start a game. Clicks the Approve button once it appears and enables auto-battle
- RAID
  - Joins the top 3 Raids with the highest rewards and AFKs
- Sequential Phantasm
  - Plays all 4 Sequential Phantasm stages
- Left-click Turbo
  - Holding middle click will spam left click



**Instructions:**
1. Download and install Autohotkey v1.1
https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe
2. Make sure the screen resolution is 1920 x 1080 and the game is fullscreen (Other resolutions are not supported at this time)
3. Download and extract the latest release of this bot 
4. Run Botify.ahk

(Optional) The Full AFK.ahk script runs a set of bots depending on what day of the week it is. (E.g. Claim daily rewards, then do Joint Operation, then do Frontier Clash)


If you find issues or have suggestions, feel free to add me on Discord Revuin#5095 or open an issue in GitHub

These are bots I originally made for myself but I’m sharing in case anyone else finds it useful.
